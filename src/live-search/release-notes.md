## Live Search 1.1.0

- Compatible with {{site.data.var.ee}} (EE): 2.4.x
- Compatible with {{site.data.var.ece}} (ECE): 2.4.x
- Stability: Stable

- {:.bug}The Live Search service supports only the [base currency]({% link stores/currency-configuration.md %}) of the {{site.data.var.ee}} installation.
- {:.bug}When adding a facet, the _Product Attributes Feed_ does not update correctly when set to `Update on Save`. To avoid this problem, go to [Index Management]({% link system/index-management.md %}) and set _Product Attributes Feed_ to `Update by Schedule`.
- {:.bug}Live Search synonyms are defined per store view, but are currently stored per website and identified with a combination of `environmentId` + `storeViewCode`. As a result, all websites and store views within the {{site.data.var.ee}} installation share the same set of synonyms. The most recently created set of synonyms for the store view takes precedence.
- {:.bug}If a synonym term contains multiple words, each word is treated as a separate synonym. For example, if you define “time piece” as a synonym of “watch”, both “time” and “piece” are treated as synonyms of watch.
